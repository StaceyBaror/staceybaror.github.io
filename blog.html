      <h2>From Research to Real-World Cybersecurity: Why I Built This Site</h2>
      <p><em>Posted June 2025</em></p>
      <p>
        As a PhD graduate in Computer Science, my journey has always been about more than publishing papers — it’s about impact.
        This website represents a new chapter. A bridge between my academic foundation and a bold professional future in cybersecurity and digital forensics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve spent the last several years leading research, developing secure systems, and mentoring students to become world-class software engineers.
        But now, I’m turning my attention to real-world problems — phishing, insider threats, digital forensics, and organizational readiness.
